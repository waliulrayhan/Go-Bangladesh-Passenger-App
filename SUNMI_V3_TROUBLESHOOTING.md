# Sunmi V3 NFC Troubleshooting Guide

## The Issue
Your Sunmi V3 has NFC hardware and it works with system apps, but our app shows "NFC Not Available".

## What We've Implemented

### Enhanced NFC Detection
- Added comprehensive NFC status checking (`checkNFCStatus()`)
- Better error messages for different failure scenarios
- Support for multiple NFC technologies (Ndef, NfcA, NfcB, etc.)
- Sunmi V3 specific logging and debugging

### Debug Tools Added
- **NFC Diagnostics Button**: Run comprehensive NFC diagnostics
- **Retry Button**: Retry NFC initialization
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed console logs for troubleshooting

## Steps to Debug on Your Sunmi V3

### 1. First Run
1. Open the app and go to driver/helper scanner
2. When you see "NFC Not Available" alert, tap "OK"
3. You'll see buttons for:
   - **Run NFC Diagnostics** (blue button)
   - **Retry NFC Initialization** (orange button)
   - **Simulate Card Detection (Demo)** (blue button)

### 2. Run Diagnostics
1. Tap "Run NFC Diagnostics"
2. This will show you:
   - NFC Supported: true/false
   - NFC Enabled: true/false
   - NFC Manager Start: SUCCESS/FAILED
   - Technology Request: SUCCESS/FAILED

### 3. Check Device Settings
If diagnostics show issues:
1. Go to Settings → More → NFC
2. Ensure NFC is enabled
3. Check "Android Beam" or "HCE Wallet" settings
4. Restart the app after enabling

### 4. Common Sunmi V3 Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "NFC Supported: false"
- **Cause**: App can't detect NFC hardware
- **Solution**: This shouldn't happen on Sunmi V3. Check app permissions.

#### Issue: "NFC Enabled: false"
- **Cause**: NFC is disabled in device settings
- **Solution**: Enable NFC in Settings → More → NFC

#### Issue: "NFC Manager Start: FAILED"
- **Cause**: Permission issues or NFC already in use
- **Solutions**:
  1. Force close other apps using NFC
  2. Restart the device
  3. Check if another app has exclusive NFC access

#### Issue: "Technology Request: FAILED"
- **Cause**: NFC technologies not accessible
- **Solution**: The app will still work, but might have limited card support

### 5. Testing Process
1. Run diagnostics first
2. If all diagnostics pass, try "Retry NFC Initialization"
3. If initialization succeeds, you should see "NFC Scanner Active" message
4. Test with your NFC card

### 6. Sunmi V3 Specific Notes
- NFC reader is usually on the back/bottom of the device
- Hold cards close to the NFC area for 2-3 seconds
- Some Sunmi devices require specific app permissions
- Try with different types of NFC cards

## Debug Console Logs

Check the development console for these logs:
- "Starting NFC initialization..."
- "NFC supported: true/false"
- "NFC enabled: true/false"
- "NFC Manager initialized successfully for Sunmi V3"
- "NFC scanning started successfully on Sunmi V3"

## If All Else Fails

### Alternative Testing:
1. Use the "Simulate Card Detection (Demo)" button
2. This will show how card processing works without real NFC
3. Check if the issue is NFC-specific or general app functionality

### Permissions Check:
Ensure in AndroidManifest.xml:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.NFC" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.nfc" android:required="false" />
```

## Next Steps for You

1. **Run the updated app** with debug features
2. **Run NFC Diagnostics** and note the results
3. **Check console logs** during initialization
4. **Try different NFC cards** if initialization succeeds
5. **Report back** with diagnostic results

The enhanced app now provides much better debugging information to help us identify exactly what's preventing NFC from working on your Sunmi V3.
