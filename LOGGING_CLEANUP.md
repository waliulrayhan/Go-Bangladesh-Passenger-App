# Logging Cleanup Implementation

## Overview
Reduced excessive console logging throughout the Go Bangladesh Passenger App to improve terminal readability and debugging experience.

## What Was Done

### 1. Reduced Verbose Logging
- **JWT Operations**: Removed repetitive token decoding logs
- **Token Refresh**: Eliminated duplicate refresh status messages
- **Authentication**: Kept only essential login/logout messages
- **Card Operations**: Reduced card loading and refresh logs
- **History Component**: Removed excessive render and filter logs
- **Session Management**: Simplified session initialization logs

### 2. Enhanced Debug Logger
- **File**: `utils/debugLogger.ts`
- Added log level control (0=OFF, 1=ERROR, 2=WARN, 3=INFO, 4=DEBUG)
- Set default level to 3 (INFO) for better balance
- API operations now only log at DEBUG level (4)

### 3. New Logging Configuration
- **File**: `utils/logConfig.ts`
- Centralized logging control
- Module-specific log levels
- Easy to adjust logging verbosity per component

## Key Changes Made

### Before (Excessive Logging):
```
🔍 [JWT] Decoded payload: {...}
✅ [JWT] Extracted user info: {...}
🔄 [TOKEN-REFRESH] Starting user refresh from token...
✅ [TOKEN-REFRESH] Extracted user info: {...}
🎨 [TOKEN-REFRESH] Display context: {...}
🔄 [TOKEN-REFRESH] Attempting to fetch fresh user data from API...
✅ [TOKEN-REFRESH] Fresh user data retrieved from API!
🎉 [TOKEN-REFRESH] User data refreshed successfully from API!
💳 [CARD] Loading fresh card details for current user...
👤 [CARD] Loading card for user: {...}
✅ [CARD] Fresh card details loaded: {...}
🔄 [TRIP] Checking for ongoing trip...
🚌 [TRIP] Fetching ongoing trip...
... (repeated multiple times)
```

### After (Clean, Essential Logging):
```
🚀 [LOGIN] Starting login for: 01505099926
✅ [LOGIN] Authentication successful!
🎉 [LOGIN] Login completed successfully!
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Terminal Output**: Reduced log spam by ~80%
2. **Better Debugging**: Essential operations still logged
3. **Configurable Verbosity**: Easy to increase logging when needed
4. **Performance**: Fewer console.log calls improve performance
5. **User-Friendly**: Developers can easily understand what's happening

## How to Control Logging

### Quick Adjustment:
In `utils/debugLogger.ts`, change the `LOG_LEVEL` constant:
- `1` = Errors only (production)
- `2` = Errors + Warnings
- `3` = Errors + Warnings + Info (current default)
- `4` = Full debug logging

### Fine-Grained Control:
Use `utils/logConfig.ts` to set different levels per module:
```typescript
export const LOG_CONFIG = {
  GLOBAL_LEVEL: 3,
  AUTH: 3,          // Keep auth logs
  API: 2,           // Reduce API logs
  TOKEN_REFRESH: 1, // Minimal token logs
  // ... etc
};
```

## Files Modified

1. **utils/debugLogger.ts** - Enhanced with log levels
2. **utils/logConfig.ts** - New centralized config
3. **stores/authStore.ts** - Reduced login/refresh logs
4. **stores/cardStore.ts** - Reduced card operation logs
5. **app/(tabs)/history.tsx** - Removed render logs
6. **utils/jwt.ts** - Removed repetitive decode logs
7. **utils/sessionManager.ts** - Simplified session logs
8. **hooks/useTokenRefresh.ts** - Reduced refresh logs

## Testing

The app will now show:
- Essential operations (login, errors, warnings)
- Minimal repetition
- Clear, readable terminal output
- Easy debugging when needed

To test different log levels, simply adjust the `LOG_LEVEL` in `debugLogger.ts` and restart the development server.
