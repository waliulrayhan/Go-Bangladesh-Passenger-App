# Registration Reload Fix

## Issue Description
After user registration, the app was reloading/rebuilding (visible in logs as "Android Bundled" messages), which caused the in-memory authentication state to be lost. This resulted in users being shown the welcome screen again despite successful registration and token storage.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. **App Reload/Hot Refresh**: After registration, the app would reload (due to Metro bundler or hot refresh)
2. **State Loss**: The Zustand store would reset to initial state (`isAuthenticated: false`)
3. **Race Condition**: The `loadUserFromStorage` function would run, but the UI would briefly show the welcome screen before authentication was restored
4. **Welcome Popup Persistence**: The welcome popup would show on every reload instead of only on fresh registration

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Added Registration Tracking
- Added `isRegistering` flag to track registration state
- Added `REGISTRATION_COMPLETE` storage key to persist registration completion
- This allows the app to differentiate between fresh registration and normal app reload

### 2. Updated AuthStore Interface
```typescript
interface AuthState {
  // ... existing properties
  isRegistering: boolean;
  // ... rest of interface
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Registration Process
- Set `isRegistering: true` at the start of registration
- Store `REGISTRATION_COMPLETE` flag in storage after successful registration
- Set `isRegistering: false` after completion or failure

### 4. Improved Load User From Storage
- Check for `REGISTRATION_COMPLETE` flag when loading user
- Show welcome popup only if registration was just completed
- Clear the registration flag after first load to prevent showing popup on subsequent reloads

### 5. Updated Storage Management
- Added `REGISTRATION_COMPLETE` to storage keys
- Updated `clearAuthData()` to clear registration flag
- Updated `clearAllAppData()` to clear registration flag

## Files Modified

### 1. `utils/constants.ts`
- Added `REGISTRATION_COMPLETE: 'registration_complete'` to `STORAGE_KEYS`

### 2. `stores/authStore.ts`
- Added `isRegistering: boolean` to `AuthState` interface
- Added `isRegistering: false` to initial state
- Updated `registerUser()` to set registration flags
- Updated `loadUserFromStorage()` to handle registration completion
- Updated `handleUnauthorized()` to clear registration flag
- Updated `clearAllAppData()` to clear registration flag

### 3. `utils/storage.ts`
- Updated `clearAuthData()` to clear registration flag
- Updated `clearAllAppData()` to clear registration flag

## How It Works Now

### Registration Flow:
1. User starts registration → `isRegistering: true`
2. Registration completes → Store `REGISTRATION_COMPLETE` flag
3. Set `isAuthenticated: true`, `showWelcomePopup: true`, `isRegistering: false`
4. User data and tokens are persisted in storage

### App Reload Flow:
1. App reloads/rebuilds → Zustand state resets
2. `loadUserFromStorage()` runs automatically
3. Finds valid token and user data
4. Checks `REGISTRATION_COMPLETE` flag
5. If flag exists → Show welcome popup and clear flag
6. If flag doesn't exist → Don't show welcome popup (normal reload)
7. Set `isAuthenticated: true` to restore user session

## Benefits
- ✅ Prevents showing welcome screen after successful registration
- ✅ Maintains authentication state across app reloads
- ✅ Shows welcome popup only on fresh registration
- ✅ Handles hot refresh gracefully
- ✅ Preserves user experience during development

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Register a new user
2. Observe that registration completes successfully
3. Verify that user stays authenticated even if app reloads
4. Check that welcome popup shows only once after registration
5. Restart the app and verify user stays logged in without welcome popup

## Prevention
This fix prevents the issue by:
- Tracking registration state properly
- Using persistent storage flags to handle app reloads
- Differentiating between fresh registration and normal app loads
- Ensuring welcome popup shows only when appropriate
